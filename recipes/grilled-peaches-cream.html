    <p1>This delicious stuffed eggplant with a cheesy top is a must-try recipe! Great as a hearty main but you can buy the mini eggplants and use them for a side dish or appetizer.</p1>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 peaches, halved and pitted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons clover honey</li>
        <li>1 cup soft cream cheese with honey and nuts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Brush peaches with a light coating of oil. Place pit side down onto the grill. Grill for 5 minutes, or until the surfaces have nice grill marks. Turn the peaches over, and drizzle with a bit of honey. Place a dollop of the cream cheese spread in the place where the pit was. Grill for 2 to 3 more minutes, or until the filling is warm. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
